**NC Alliance for Health Professions | January 6, 2026**

## 🔬 About This Repository
This repository contains the frameworks, policy drafts, and curriculum resources presented by **Dr. Steven Grambow (Duke CTSI)** at the NC Alliance for Health Professions.

**The Core Thesis:**
We are moving from the era of "Magic Tricks" (Stateless Chat) to "Stewardship" (Agentic Workflows). To prepare the next generation of the health workforce, we must move beyond banning AI and start **architecting** the way students interact with it.

## 🧠 Key Frameworks

### The Duke Medical Taxonomy of AI Use
We do not view AI as binary (Allowed/Banned). We use a **Tiered Cognitive Framework**:

| Tier | Definition | The Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 0** | **Unaided Cognition** (Tech-Free) | *"Foundational memory must be protected."* |
| **Tier 1** | **AI-Restricted** (Search/Support) | *"AI is the Librarian, not the Author."* |
| **Tier 2** | **AI-Documented** (Drafting) | *"You are not the Writer; you are the **Sponsor**."* |
| **Tier 3** | **AI-Integrated** (Mandatory) | *"The human is the safety catch."* |

### Infrastructure as Access (The FCAP Pilot)
We are piloting a **Federated "Compute-to-Data" Bridge** to connect regional institutions (NCCU, Durham Tech) with real-world clinical datasets.
* **The Goal:** Democratize "Data Fluency" without compromising patient privacy.
* **The Pilot:** Launching Spring 2026.
