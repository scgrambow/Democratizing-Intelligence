## 📖 The Narrative: A Shift in Competency

We are witnessing a fundamental evolution in how intelligence works in healthcare. This repository outlines our strategy to move from "Magic Tricks" (simple chat) to "Stewardship" (reliable workflow architecture).

### Act I: The Calibration (The Velocity of Change)
If you feel like the technology landscape is moving too fast to focus on, you aren't wrong. It is like being on a high-speed train; looking at the trees whizzing by results in a blur. To understand where we are going, we have to look at the horizon.

We have moved from the "Magic 8-Ball" era of simple chat to the era of the **Digital Employee**. The "medical note"—that sacred text of clinical training—is now being automated by tools like Abridge and DAX Copilot. This creates a tension: How do we teach cognitive synthesis when the machine does the mechanical work?

### Act II: The Shift (From Asking to Guiding)
If the machine writes the note, the human's job is no longer "writing." **The job is Architecture.**

AI agents are like fast, eager interns with infinite potential but zero judgment. The core competency of the future isn't "Prompt Engineering"; it is **Workflow Architecture**—the ability to take Raw Intent and wrap it in a safety layer of context, constraints, and verification. We are moving from a workforce of "Users" to a workforce of "Architects."

### Act III: The Framework (The Stewardship Sandbox)
We must replace the binary trap of "Did you use AI?" with the stewardship question: "How did you verify the output?".

However, we face an equity crisis. If only students at major academic medical centers have access to secure data to practice this stewardship, we widen the rural-urban divide.

**The Solution:** We are building a **Federated Stewardship Sandbox**. Imagine a "Visiting Agent" model where a student in a rural community college can send an algorithm to a secure Duke data vault. The code goes in, insights come out, but patient data never leaves. This democratizes access to real-world health data fluency.

### Act IV: The Invitation (Building Together)
No single institution can solve this alone. We need shared infrastructure to build capacity and training for AI stewardship across North Carolina.

Duke CTSI, in partnership with NCCU and Durham Tech, is building the **TRUST AI** curriculum not to sell it, but to share it. We want to work with you—the educators, the program directors, the people building the pipeline—to orchestrate these pathways for learners across the region.

## 🛠 The Technical Frameworks

### 1. The FCAP Infrastructure (Compute-to-Data)
To solve the "Data Divide," we are pivoting the **Duke Federated Clinical Analytics Platform (FCAP)** from a research tool into an educational sandbox.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Problem** | Regional learners are "locked out" of the massive, multimodal datasets required to develop marketable health AI skills. |
| **The Solution** | **"Compute-to-Data" Bridge:** Instead of moving sensitive data out (high risk), we bring learner algorithms *into* a secure enclave. |
| **The Outcome** | A scalable infrastructure where students practice "Human-in-the-Loop" workflows on real data without compromising patient privacy. |

### 2. The Policy Taxonomy (Hierarchy of Use)
We propose moving beyond binary "Allowed/Not Allowed" policies to a tiered framework of use:

* **🧠 Tier 0: AI-Disallowed (Unaided Cognition)**
    * *Scenario:* The Foundational Exam.
    * *Rule:* Strictly Prohibited.
    * *Why:* We must verify foundational critical thinking and memory retention ("No Wifi" zones).

* **🧭 Tier 1: AI-Restricted (Supportive & Formative)**
    * *Scenario:* The Literature Review.
    * *Rule:* Permitted for search & inquiry (with attribution).
    * *Why:* AI acts as a research assistant, not an author.

* **📝 Tier 2: AI-Documented (Generative & Collaborative)**
    * *Scenario:* The Co-Authored Draft.
    * *Rule:* Permitted with **Audit Trail**.
    * *Why:* The student must prove "Human Sponsorship" and ownership via verification logs.

* **🤝 Tier 3: AI-Integrated (Mandatory & Systemic)**
    * *Scenario:* The Clinical Simulation.
    * *Rule:* Mandatory / Systemic Use.
    * *Why:* Evaluation focuses on the student's ability to safely manage the AI workflow.
